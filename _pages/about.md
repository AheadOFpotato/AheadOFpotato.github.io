I am now a first-year Ph.D. student at [the Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Peking University](https://www.ai.pku.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Muhan Zhang](https://muhanzhang.github.io/). Welcome to visit our group page: [Graphpku](https://github.com/GraphPKU)!

I received my B.S. in Physics from [School of Physics, Peking University](https://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/), where I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Huichao Song](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1029601?ui-citation-summary=true&ui-exclude-self-citations=true) on ML applications in heavy-ion collision.

I am dedicated to exploring the **reasoning mechanisms of large language models** (LLMs) and researching how to enhance the models' reasoning capabilities to the level of human experts. Additionally, I have a keen interest in various topics related to LLMs, including efficiency, alignment, and applications across different downstream domains etc. If you share these research interests, please feel free to get in touch!

(I have recently moved to this site, the website is still under construction.)
