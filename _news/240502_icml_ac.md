Our paper: [Case-Based or Rule-Based: How Do Transformers Do the Math?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17709) is accepted by ICML 2024 !!! In our paper, we demonstrate that current large language models are performing **case-based reasoning rather than rule-based reasoning** like humans in math reasoning tasks, revealing the intrinsic reasons for the models' limitations in length generalization. To bridge this gap and shift the models' reasoning paradigm closer to rule-based reasoning, we propose **Rule-Following Fine-Tuning**. This method enhances the models' ability to follow rules, thereby improving their performance in length generalization.
